# Responsive Design Workflow book site: design guidelines

This page contains the design standards used in creating the book site. These guidelines can be used to create subsequent pages or other web projects related to the book.

## Background

The site has been designed to be a companion to the book, in terms of both visuals and content. The basic color palette, typography, and other aspects of the book's design language have been ported to the web, while attempting to remain consistent with the look and feel of the book. The biggest difference between the book site and the design of the book itself is in regard to layout: the website uses a responsive approach, in which the layout may change depending on the size of the user's screen. Content remains consistent regardless of the device.

## Responsiveness and breakpoints

There are three major breakpoints for the page layout: `400px`, `600px` and `900px`. The following examples show how the website looks at these three viewport widths:

## The main heading

The main heading of the page is also the title of the book, and has a different appearance than normal headings:
